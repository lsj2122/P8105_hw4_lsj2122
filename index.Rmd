### Welcome to My Personal Website!

![](images/me.jpeg)

My name is Laylah Jones. I am a Masters of Science student in Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. This website was created as a product of the P8105 - Data Science I course.

Please feel free the browse around the website. You can find a little bit about my academic and professional experience here in the [about](about.html) page. You can also navigate to my Dashboard, where there are some examples of distinct plots using Instacart data here: [dashboard](dashboard.html). And lastly, at the top, you can click on the various icons where you will be sent to my Gmail, LinkedIn page, and GitHub account with other projects made with R Studio.
