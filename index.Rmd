### Welcome to my personal website!

![](images/me.jpeg)

My name is Laylah Jones. I am a Masters of Science student in Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. This website was created as a product of the P8105 - Data Science I course.

Please feel free the browse around the website. You can find a little bit about my academic and professional experience, my GitHub account where various projects made with R Studio, and other links here in the [about](about.html) page. You can also find a flexdashboard with some examples of distinct plots here in the [dashboard](dashboard.html).
